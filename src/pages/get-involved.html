          <p>Please don't worry if you have never skated before, this is what this programme is all about! Most people will be in exactly the same boat as you and we are here to support you on your own journey of growth and fitness.</p>
          <p>We are also looking for skating officials, so if you feel that contact is not for you, we can guide you along the process of becoming a roller derby referee.</p>
