          <p>Hulls Angels Roller Derby are proud to be hosting our first beginners programme of 2020!</p>
          <p><strong>Welcome Rookies!</strong></p>
          <p>We are opening our doors once again to those of you who want to try something new and be a part of our inclusive, body positive and friendly league of diverse people!</p>
          <p>Our beginners coach Stacey will guide you through a 12 week programme of skills, drills and contact training where you can learn the basics from how to stand on your own two feet to your first 'hits'!</p>
          <p>Please don't worry if you have never skated before, this is what this programme is all about! Most people will be in exactly the same boat as you and we are here to support you on your own journey of growth and fitness.</p>
          <p>We are also looking for skating officials, so if you feel that contact is not for you, we can guide you along the process of becoming a roller derby referee.</p>

          <p>First session is free, then Â£6.50 thereafter which covers your kit hire and coaching.</p>
          <p>REQUIREMENTS:<br>18 years old and above.<br>Female identifying or non-binary.<br>If you are male identifying we can teach you to skate with a view of becoming a skating official, but not for contact training.<br>For more information please contact us through our <a href='https://www.facebook.com/events/2591122041170844/' target='_blank'>Facebook event page</a></p>  -->
