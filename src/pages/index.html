title: Hulls Angels Roller Derby | Hull | East Yorkshire | HARD
description: Hulls Angels Roller Derby is a Flat Track Roller Derby League based in Hull, East Yorkshire. We were originally formed in September 2010 after taking inspiration from the resurgence of the sport in the United States.  Hulls Angels Roller Derby became affliated with WFTDA in 2013. Over the years we have become a diverse and strong league, filled with skaters, officials and volunteers that have allowed us to be in the top 110 teams in Europe (Flat Track Stats) and top 50 in the UK (UKRDA Stats).
